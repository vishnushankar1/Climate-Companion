# Weather Forecast Application

This is a simple weather forecast application that retrieves weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It provides real-time weather information for a specific city entered by the user.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- requests library
- json library
- tabulate library

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:


3. Sign up on OpenWeatherMap and obtain an API key.
4. Open the `weather_forecast.py` file and replace the `api_key` variable with your own API key.
5. Run the script:


6. Enter the name of the city for which you want to retrieve the weather forecast.
7. The application will display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description in a tabular format.

## Error Handling

The application incorporates error handling for various scenarios, including invalid API keys, city not found, and exceeding the API rate limit.

## Limitations

- The application uses the metric system, displaying temperature in Celsius and wind speed in meters per second.
- It assumes a successful internet connection and valid API key.
